## Session book condenser

A short programme to condense a full ABC tunebooke into a shortened A6 version containing only the first line of each tune.
Could also be altered to create contents pages for an ABC tunebook. For more information, visit my blog: https://lankfish.com/2024/02/18/abc-notation-tunebook-condenser/

The file assumes a standard ABC Notation layout for each tune, with a header at the top containig informaton fields.
It also assumes the book is sorted by tune type, where each section is seperated by a title enclosed in %%% symbols e.g:  
%%%%%%%%   
% 32 bar jigs %   
%%%%%%%%   
These section heading starts a new page in the condensed book.

There is an optional part of the script for correctly wrapping the A6 pages for double-sided A4 printing, however it is not very robust, so if you change any of the formatting, it may not work.
