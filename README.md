## Session book condenser

A short programme to condense a full ABC tunebooke into a shortened A5 version containing only the first line of each tune.
Could also be altered to create contents pages for an ABC tunebook 

The file assumes a standard ABC Notation layout for each tune, with a header at the top containig informaton fields.
It also assumes the book is sorted by tune type, where each section is seperated by a title enclosed in %%% symbols e.g:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% 32 bar jigs %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
These section headings take up a page in condensed output.
